# Implementation Plan

[Overview]
Integrate a chat interface into the Foodly web application, allowing users to interact with the conversational agent service.

This project will add a real-time chat component to the existing web UI. The interface will send user messages to the agent service, receive the agent's responses, and display them in a conversational format. This will provide a more intuitive and interactive way for users to manage their nutrition.

[Types]
No new types, classes, or data structures are required for this implementation.

[Files]
- **`foodly/app/templates/index.html`**: This file will be modified to include the HTML and JavaScript for the chat interface.
- **`foodly/app/main.py`**: This file will be modified to add a new endpoint for handling chat messages.
- **`requirements.txt`**: This file will be modified to add the `httpx` library for making HTTP requests to the agent service.

[Functions]
- **`chat(request: Request, user_message: str = Form(...))`**: A new function will be added to `foodly/app/main.py`. This function will handle POST requests from the chat interface, forward the user's message to the agent service, and return the agent's response.

[Classes]
No new classes are required for this implementation.

[Dependencies]
- **`httpx`**: This library will be added to `requirements.txt` to enable the web application to make HTTP requests to the agent service.

[Testing]
No new tests will be added as part of this implementation.

[Implementation Order]
1.  Add `httpx` to `requirements.txt`.
2.  Add the `chat` endpoint to `foodly/app/main.py`.
3.  Add the chat interface to `foodly/app/templates/index.html`.
